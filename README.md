# W209_Final_Project

Summary of the folder structure:

There are 6 html pages: the index page, a separate page for each ML model we're working on, and a test page (for testing/sharing ideas without having to worry about screwing up any of the other pages).

Each html page has a dedicated folder. The whole job of this folder is to handle any and all modifications of its corresponding html page. Inside of the folder will go all of the ipynb's, images, model-specific js scripts, bokeh-outputted html files, etc. that correspond to that webpage.  By having a separate folder dedicated to each page, we can all organize our thoughts in whatever way makes sense to us individually, while still keeping the root directory clean and organized.

Finally, there is another folder called "libraries" for storing shared external files. Right now it contains the js/css files for bokeh and jquery. Add any other files here that you think someone else may end up using.
